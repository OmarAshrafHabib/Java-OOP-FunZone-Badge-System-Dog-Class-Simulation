# Java OOP: FunZone Badge System & Dog Class Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates key Java OOP concepts through two applications:
1. **Dog Class Simulation**: Models a simple `Dog` class with attributes for a dog’s name, age, and age in "human years." The project includes methods for managing dog attributes and calculating age equivalency.
2. **FunZone Badge System**: A system to track visitor activities and charges in a fictional entertainment center. The `FunZoneBadge` class manages visitor information, badge ID, accumulated charges, and calculates donations.

## Features
- **OOP Principles**: Shows encapsulation and object interaction with constructors, accessors, and mutators.
- **Javadoc Documentation**: Each class and method includes Javadoc comments for clarity.
- **Driver Programs**: `DogTestDriver` and `FunZoneDriver` test each application’s functionality, simulating user interactions and displaying outputs.

## Usage
1. Compile `Dog.java`, `DogTestDriver.java`, `FunZoneBadge.java`, and `FunZoneDriver.java`.
2. Run each driver to test the Dog and FunZoneBadge functionality, respectively.

## Documentation
Generate Javadoc documentation by running:
```bash
javadoc -author -private Dog.java FunZoneBadge.java
