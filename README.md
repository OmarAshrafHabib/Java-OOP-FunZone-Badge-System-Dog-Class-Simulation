# Java-OOP-FunZone-Badge-System-Dog-Class-Simulation

This project contains two Java applications designed to demonstrate fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation, and Javadoc documentation in Java. The first application simulates a simple Dog class with attributes and methods to model a pet’s characteristics and behaviors. The second application, the FunZone Entertainment Center simulation, introduces a FunZoneBadge system to track visitor interactions and expenses within an entertainment center, featuring methods for calculating charges and charitable donations.

Both simulations include driver programs for testing and generating formatted outputs, showcasing:

 - Classes and Objects: Creation of custom classes with constructors, accessor, and mutator methods.
 - Encapsulation and Data Management: Use of private instance variables with accessor and mutator methods.
 - Java Documentation: Javadoc comments for each class, method, and variable, along with HTML documentation generated using Javadoc utility.

These assignments were developed as part of a computer science course to deepen understanding of Java’s class structure and foundational OOP concepts.
